_**Poem of Tecumseh**_
======================

### _Live your life that fear of death can never enter your heat._

### _Trouble no one about his religion. _

### _Respect others and their views and demand they respect  yours._

### _ Love your life , perfect your life_

### _Beautify all things in your life_

### _Seek to make your life long and of service to your people_

### _When your time comes to die_

### _Be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death._

### _So that when their time comes they weep and pray_

### _For a little more time to live their lives over again in different way_

### _Sing your death song and die like a hero going home_
